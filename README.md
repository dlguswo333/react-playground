# @dlguswo333/react-playground
This repository is for playing around React.
Therefore minimal, lightweight, and not production-ready.

If you want typescript, switch to `typescript` branch.

# Project Structure
```
src : Source code directory.
    ├ index.jsx : Render App component in html.
    └ App.jsx : Root React component.
index.html : It is what the file name says.
```
